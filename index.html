    <h1>From Streets to Homes</h1>
    <p>In the heart of Austin, stray animals live quietly among us, waiting for a second chance. 
      This is their journey—from the streets to the homes that offer them a fresh start. 
      Join us in exploring how hope and action meet in the city’s shelter system.</p>

    <h2>Where Strays Are Found</h2>
    <p>Take a look at this map, where you can see where stray animals are most often found in Austin. 
      Some areas pop up more than others, showing us where help is needed the most. 
      As these hotspots shift, it’s clear which neighborhoods need rescue efforts the most. </p>

    <h2>Regional Distribution</h2>
    <p>Ever wonder where stray animals are most often taken in? This map paints a clear picture—some neighborhoods, especially in East and Southeast Austin, show significantly higher intake numbers than others. 
      These hotspots highlight where rescue efforts are most needed and where shelter access might be falling short. 
      It also raises a bigger question we’ll explore further: does where an animal is found influence what happens next?</p>

    <h2>Monthly Shelter Intake</h2>
    <p>Here’s a glimpse into the rhythm of Austin’s shelters over the years. 
      From 2013 to 2025, the number of animals entering the system rose and fell with the seasons—until 2020, when the curve dropped sharply. 
      The pandemic hit, and the city’s intake numbers were never quite the same. 
      Since then, the pace has slowed, with fewer animals arriving each month. 
      Whether this means fewer strays or fewer resources is still a question worth exploring.</p>

    <h2>Shelter Coverage & Intakes</h2>
    <p>
      This map overlays 5‑km service circles for every animal shelter (blue rings with house icons)
      on top of neighborhood‑level intake counts (yellow → blue shading) and clustered records of 
      animals that have already been taken in (yellow → blue = more cases). <br>
      It quickly shows where intake pressure is greatest, how well shelter coverage lines up with that demand, 
      and which fringe areas still lie outside any shelter radius.

    <h2>Intake → Outcome Flow</h2>
    <p>
      This Sankey uses warm tones (peach / pastel yellow) for intake sources and cool pastel blue/gray for final outcomes.<br>
      - “Stray” and “Owner Surrender” are the two dominant entry points.<br>
      - Well over half of those animals reach Adoption or Transfer, showing a strong rescue‑to‑placement pipeline.<br>
      - Euthanasia, No Outcome, Lost and similar results form only thin streams, reflecting Austin’s progress toward its no‑kill goal.<br>
      In short, wide warm streams narrow into cool outcome nodes—highlighting the main rescue‑to‑placement path and the few small branches that still need attention.
