    <h1>From Streets to Homes</h1>
    <p>In the heart of Austin, stray animals are quietly living among us, waiting for their moment to be noticed. From the bustling streets to the quiet corners, they wander, unnoticed, until they’re given a second chance. This is their story—a journey through the city’s shelter system, where hope meets action. Join us as we explore the path these animals take, from the streets to the homes that offer them a fresh start.</p>
